# NEVER TOUCH NODE_MODULES AND PACKAGE-LOCK.JSON
## Bundler
In the original create-react-app, the bundler is **WEBPACK**\
Other bundlers include parcel, vite etc

## ***installing parcel as a dev dependency***/
```
npm i -D parcel
```

## Caret and Tilde in version
*Caret(^)- means it will update major versions*\
*Tilde(~)- represents it will upgrade to minor versions*\
~version - “Approximately equivalent to version”, will update you to all future patch versions, without incrementing the minor version. ~1.2.3 will use releases from 1.2.3 to <1.3.0.

^version - “Compatible with version”, will update you to all future minor/patch versions, without incrementing the major version. ^1.2.3 will use releases from 1.2.3 to <2.0.0.

## package-lock.json
locks the dependencies to a current version to prevent blunder
- locks the version
- do not keep in .gitignore
- it also maintains a hash of the dependency("integrity") (to check the exact same version is on production or not)

## node_modules
database for npm installs\
**WE do not put node_modules in github as our package-lock.json contains sufficient information to create node_modules**
-We can generate node_modules on our server

Using CDN is not a good way, coz React may keep getting updated But **packages** make sure of updates

Browser doesnt understand **import**
We need to specify type = module in browser index.html

## Parcel
Use npx parcel index.html to execute parcel and our server
```
npx parcel index.html
```
- *Creates a live-server*
- *Hot Module Replacement(HMR)- Parcel will keep a track of all the files in index.html*
- *Parcel uses **File Watcher Algorithm** written in C++- Keeps a track of all the files in real time*
- Parcel needs some space to do its tasks and is stored in *parcel-cache*
- dist folder keeps all files in minified form
- npx parcel index.html - makes faster development build of our project and serves it on the server
- When we run ```npx parcel build index.html```, it makes a production build of the project and keeps it in dist folder

**Parcel does**
- Bundling
- Minifying
- Clearing all the console logs
- Manages dev and production build
- Image Optimization
- Caching while development
- Renames variables in our code
- compatibility with older version of browser- using **browserlist** *(provided by parcel)*
- adds polyfills
- provides functionality to use HTTPS on dev
```npx parcel index.html --https```
- manages port numbers
- Consistent Hashing algorithm
- Zero Config

**WE SHOULD PUT parcel.cache in .gitignore** because it can be autogenerated

## Transitive Dependencies - 
Dependencies depending on other dependencies 

## Browserlist
provides support for older browsers
- broswerslist.dev
```
"browsersList": [
    "last 2 versions"
]
```
**parcel makes sure our app works in last 2 version of all the browsers available**
```
"browsersList": [
    "last 2 Chrome versions"
]
```
**Only last 2 versions of chrome supported**

```
"browsersList": [
    "cover 99% in US"
]
```
***covers 99% browsers in US***
