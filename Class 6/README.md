The most expensive operation in UI state change is the **DOM Manipulation**.
- ***React is fast because of its fast DOM manipulation***
- Virtual DOM
- Reconciliation
- Tree Diffing algorithm
- React re renders the entire component on every key press and it does it very fast

## useEffect hook 
useEffect() hook takes 2 parameters:-
- Callback function
- dependency array
```
useEffect((callback function)=>{
  console.log("render");
},[dependency_array]);
```
- The callback function is called on every re- render
- Suppose we want to call this useEffect() on a certain condition, we pass that it in the dependency array
```
useEffect((callback function)=>{
  console.log("call this when dependency is changed");
},[**searchText**]);
```
- Now the useEffect callback is triggered whenever there is a change in the **searchText** state variable
- If it is not dependent on anything, it is called once (dependency empty)
- When empty dependency array, callback function called once after render
- When array => [searchText] => once after render + everytime fter re-render when my searchText changes

## Shimmer UI
- A shimmer UI resembles the page's actual UI, so users will understand how quickly the web or mobile app will load even before the content has shown up.
- It gives people an idea of whats about to come and whats happening (its currently loading) when a page full of content/data takes more than 3-5 seconds to load.

## Conditional Rendering
If restaurant is empty => shimmer UI
if restaurant has data => actual data UI

## JavaScript inside {}
- only JavaScript expressions work
```
{
let a = 10;
console.log(a);
}
```
- Above doesnt work as not a valid javascript expression
- above are statements

```
((a=10), console.log(a))
```
-We can write this to make it work

## Fetch API
Although we have the Response object now, we can't access the data inside it right away. The response object returned by await fetch supports multiple functions for different data formats, which include:

- response.json(): Returns data as a JSON Object.
- response.text(): Returns data in raw text.
- response.formData(): Returns data as FormData.
